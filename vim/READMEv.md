## Do I Actually Use All These?

Always in effect:
- airline
- numbers (non relative numbers in insert)
- vim-signature (marks in gutter)
- taboo (tab naming and use with unite)
- delimitMate (may switch to one kana's similar plugin)

Using constantly:
- Unite (and vimproc, neomru, etc.)
- Sneak
- vim-session (every time close)
- buffkill.vim (ever time kill a buffer)
- vundle (to install anything new; going to switch to neobundle)
- tcomment (all commenting)

With some frequency:
- smart tabs
- insertlessly (may stop using)
- vimwiki (link saving)

Occasional use:
- gundo
- vim-eunuch
- vim-markdown-folding (i.e for this readme)

Experimenting with:
- pterosaur (haven't got working)
- calendar.vim
- vim-arpeggio (an interesting idea)
- vimshell
- goldenview
- neocomplete
- submodes

To start using:
- some text object plugins
- neosnippets or ultisnips for headings
